# Face-Recognizer-using-OpenCV-and-face-recongnization

An application which recognize any face and also shows the name if their face is known to this application.

Also notes down the time and date if a known face id detected in Attendance list. 

I have made this application for taking attendace in class.

***To run this code***
*Step 1.* Create a folder in images and name that folder as the Scholar ID of the student \\
*Step 2.* Add photos of the students with Scholar ID same as the folder \\
*Step 3.* Run *create_encodings.py* to train the model with the faces \\
*Step 4.* Run *main.py* for the attendance \\

*Record.py* is a to add new student in the database and also to get attendance reocrd.
